# Josephus_Traversal
  
   Letâ€™s start with the two inputs, the number of people in the circle N and the number that are skipped every time k. 
   By knowing k means we know the number of people skipped between the person
   who is dying and the next person dying is (k-1).
  
  
            %   :param n: The number of objects in the circle (array)
            %   :param k: The number of skips after an object is removed
            %   :return: The position of the final object left
